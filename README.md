# Cifre

Cifre is a fast crypto toolkit for modern client-side JavaScript.  This is done by taking the best crypto code for js on the net and updating it to use modern technologies like typed arrays for better performance and easier integration with binary data.

This project is still in heavy development, more docs to come soon.
